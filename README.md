## How to get started

1. First, make sure that you have npm installed on your system (follow the instructions
   at [Installing Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

2. Run `npm install` through the terminal in the root of the repository. Let it
   install all the dependencies.

3. Run `npm start` through the terminal. This will start the webserver and the application should pop up in your
   browser ready for use. Alternatively you can open in through [http://localhost:3000]. Whenever you make changes in your code and save, the browser will update automatically, so you don't have to click refresh anymore.
